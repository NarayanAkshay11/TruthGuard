# Truth Guard

##### A Novelle solution to fake news detection which inspired my SC1015 DSAI Final Project

### Idea : 
A web-browser which can read the text on your screen and give the likelyhood of it being true.

### Execution as of now
 1. Sequential Neural Network Model trained and tested

## Path Forward
 1. Designing a web-browser to extract text from the screen.

 2. Employing the model for classification/regression (depending on the 2 trained models)
    
 3. Add web-scraping capabilities

## Contributions

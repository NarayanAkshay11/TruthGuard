                        <h3>Final Prompt</h3>
                        <p>Jeremy is a handsome, white 35 year-old office worker in Singapore who does not have spare time outside work. He absorbs all the news that is sent through his subscription services on various news outlets and online websites. He does not have time to fact check any sort of news sent to him while working. One day, while using his laptop, he found some news online that godzilla was approaching Singapore. Without a sense of doubt, he panics and calls up his family and friends to inform them of the news. Due to his credentials in his job and usual reliable personality, his friends and family also believes the news and similarly shares the news among their circles. Soon enough, the news reaches every corner of Singapore. After a few days, he received a call from the authorities informing him of his behavior in spreading fake news. Then, he finally realizes that the news he sent to his friends and family about godzilla was fake. Even though it was out of concern, Jeremy made the crucial mistake of not fact checking the information he receives and unknowingly shared false information. It was a fine lesson he had learnt.
                          This story showcases one of many ways through which someone can fall prey to misinformation on the internet. While it is overly exaggerated for anyone to believe that godzilla even exists, there are cases in which people believe in seemingly obviously fake news. It then begs the question, “How can we reduce the number of internet users who are gullible to fake news?”  
                          The story pauses and rewinds back to the beginning with the narrator saying “What if Jeremy had a tool that could help him verify the news he receives without wasting too much time?” This time round, when Jeremy receives a notification from the various online websites he is subscribed to, ‘TruthGuard’, a browser extension pops up and informs him that. The news of godzilla treading the waters of Singapore is 85% unreliable and thus likely to be false. Jeremy thus sighs a heave of relief and continues on with his day.
                          Display “How was truth guard created?” on the screen.
                          Truth Guard was first creating using a multi-disciplinary approach involving concepts of quantitative analysis, digital misinformation and artificial intelligence.
                          The team first found 700,000 datapoints of text data labeled as true/false. This data was cleaned to remove null values and the text was tokenized. Tokenized means that the word was changed to its root form. For example, creating is converted to create. 
                          After this, the chosen AI model was fit with this training data. It was later tested using different data to gauge its accuracy. Once it was pretty accurate, a front-end interface was added as part of the browser extension.
                          Display “How different is this from existing solutions?” on the screen.
                          The closest form of fake news detection that is reputable and well-established is Snopes.com, which has an investigative team that manually researches and fact checks viral outlandish news. It does not have a browser extension to make the fact-checking process a lot easier on the reader, and does not utilize artificial intelligence.
                          Display “Broader implications and potential future applications” on the screen.
                          Adjust the functionalities to subdue privacy concerns.
                          Modify ML techniques to detect deep fakes, edited videos and images.
                          Add in features to extract text from images, to aid social platforms in detecting fake news using our model.
                          In essence, our software informs the reader of the accuracy of a particular news by analyzing the text and cross-referencing the news with other sources.

    "You will see *uninformed search* algorithms, namely **Breadth First Search**, **Depth First Search**, **Uniform Cost Search**, **Depth Limited Search** and **Iterative Depth Search**. The setup is a typical Sudoku puzzle, utilizing a 9x9 grid. In total, there are 81 cells in the puzzle, with 9 cells contained in each of the 9 blocks. Some cells will have numbers that are pre-filled. To solve the puzzle, the agent must fill up all 81 cells with a number from 1 to 9 inclusive, where each row and column of the grid contains each number exactly once. In this Jupyter Notebook, you will learn how to create and display a sudoku grid clearly, and then apply the various search algorithms on the grid to solve the puzzle.\n",
